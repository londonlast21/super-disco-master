# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description:
This is an app that can be used to track tasks and their upcoming due dates.

Click on the time slot of the task you want to enter, and type your information into the prompt.
Click on the white lock icon on the far right to save your task.
As tasks start to approach deadlines, the color of their bar on the chart will change:

* red is for tasks due this hour
* grey is for tasks past due
* green is for tasks due in the future

When you refresh the page, your information will be retained! :)
